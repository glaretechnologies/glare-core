Some files from FreeType version 2.13.2, Downloaded 29 Jan 2024.


include\freetype\config\ftmodule.h has been modified to disable some modules we don't need. (We don't need to load bitmap fonts etc.)
We just want to support OTF and TTF formats.

include\freetype\config\ftoption.h has been modified to define FT_CONFIG_OPTION_ERROR_STRINGS

Also undefined FT_CONFIG_OPTION_MAC_FONTS.

Defined FT_CONFIG_OPTION_SYSTEM_ZLIB to use the existing zlib.
